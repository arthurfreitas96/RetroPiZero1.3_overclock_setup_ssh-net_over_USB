I managed to make lr-gpsp work. It was necessary to downgrade RetroPie and now I am using version 3.8,
because I was looking forward to replicate this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgbr6ybhhCU. After some research,
I found out that lr-gpsp is broken on RetroPie 4.6, but there is a known work around that requires replacing the gpsp_libreto.so
with the previous version of the core (4.5), according to the user juchong
in https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/25111/lr-gpsp-giving-illegal-instruction-on-raspberry-pi-models-0w-3b-and-4/22.
Following this method didn't solve my problem and I couldn't make lr-gpsp to work on RetroPie 4.6, so I downgraded, but kept my
overclocking configuration.
Now I have gba at full speed in all games i tested until now, with nice sound too, using lr-gpsp. Just like in the previous setup,
I also got nice emulation for snes, nes, gbc, gb and others.

After downgrading to 3.8, I couldn't set SSH or Internet sharing over USB though.

Current setup:

-Included the following lines in the RPi's config.txt:
arm_freq=1050
over_voltage=8
core_freq=500
v3d_freq=333
h264_freq=333
isp_freq=333
sdram_freq=500
over_voltage_sdram=4

-Set video driver to dispmanx in RetroArch settings->drivers

-Set resolution to 640x480

-Included the correct gba_bios.bin in /home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS
